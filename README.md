# JSL05 Challenge
## Overview:
I was tasked with creating a "create task" button and modal where new tasks
are stored inside of Local storage to ensure that tasks are not deleted upon
page reload or page close.

## How to run:
* Download the files and folder in the repo
* Place the files within a folder
* Run the folder inside of Visual studio Code
* Use the Live View feature to run the web page

## Technology used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Initial thoughts:
I came into the project very confident. I learned from my mistake from the previous
project and with that I didn't see anything in the brief that struck out to me as 
"difficult" or "challenging" aside from finding out how to store tasks in the localStorage.

## Struggles/How I overcame them:
* I didn't understand how to store the tasks inside of localStorage.Through asking my teacher and watching youtube videos
on localStorage I eventually managed to understand and properly implement it in my code.

* Getting the tasks to stay after reloading the page/closing the page. There was a line that overwrote the localStorage
by defaulting back to the InitialTasks regardless of if it was saved.

* Only near the end of my project did I realize I had to seperate my single script.js into separate modules, so having to
re-link them and place them in their right spots without breaking the code was a challenge.
